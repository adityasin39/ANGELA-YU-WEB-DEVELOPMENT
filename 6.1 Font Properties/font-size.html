<!--Point is a unit which is larger than a pixel and is static and is used as pt.
em is a unit which is a relative unit and it is relative to the parent(closest). It is 100% of the parent like for e.g . if we have h1 in a body and if the font-size of the body is set to 20px and the h1 is set to 1em then it means 20px and if it is 2em then 40px and so on.
rem is a unit which is a relative unit and it is relative to the root(which is ofcourse the html element).It is 100% of the root like for e.g. if the font-size of html is 20px and if the font size of h1 is 1rem then it is 20px and if 2rem then 40px and so on.
rem is a better unit as it is relative to the root so on changing the font-size of the parent doesnt affect the font-size of the one using rem.
there are also word based font sizes like large,medium.
font-weight can be relative to parent too like lighter or bolder. Ligher means it will minus 100 and bolder means it will plus 100 write font-weight:lighter; to use it.
font-weight can be used as a number too where its range is 100-900. larger the number bolder the font.
