<!--Combining CSS selectors.
We always have to write many classes for different elements and if we have to apply the same css rule to all these elements then its waste of time as well as space as it takes a lot of lines so we can combine selectors.
The first type of combining is grouping.second is parent-child,third is ancestor-descendant,fourth is chainselector
You can also combine combiners.-->
