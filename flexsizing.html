<!--By default there is no space between flex items. The flex items start from the starting edge and they stack in a line and the width of each flex item is equal to the content size.
To do the flexbox sizing when the item is shrunken or grown, the flex box has a priority list=  content width<width<flex-basis<min-width/max-width. First max-width/min-width is checked and if it is not set then flex-basis is checked and if that too is not set then width is checked in case of a row based flexbox and the height in a column based flexbox and if that too is not set then content width is checked.
The maximum width of a flexbox item by default is the width taken up by the longest line of the text and the minimum width is the longest word so when the screen is at max width then we will have the max width of flex item ie. it will try to have all of its content on one line but if it is not possible then the longest line will only occupy the same line and other lines will go down. But if the window is shrunken then the min width will be taken by each flex item as long as the window size is enough otherwise the flex item will be invisible.This is the default behaviour of flexbox which we can change ofcourse.
By default if the flex items dont have enough content to cover the  entire screen then they dont stretch to cover the entire screen.
If we set width:100px to all the flex items then initially all the flex items will have the width as 100 px but when the screen is shrunk then it will try to have the width as long as all the flex items are able to have that width otherwise it wiil follow the default longest word property.
If there is a row based flexbox and if the width of each flex item is set to 100 px and also the flex-basis of each flex item is set to 200px then the more important property is flex-basis so width will be ignored completely and when we have max screen size or when there is enough space then the width of each flex item will be equal to the flex basis but as soon as we shrink, if there is not enough space then the longest word thing will happen again.
If there is a row based flexbox and if the flex basis of each item is set to 200px and the max-width of each flex item is set to 100px then as max-width is smaller so max width will be considered when there is enough space and on shrinking the same rules will follow as above.But if the flex-basis were 50px instead of 200 then flex-basis will be considered and max-width would be ignored.
max width is the maximum growth potential of a flex item and min width is the shrink potential.
If there is a row based flexbox and if the flex-basis of each item is set to 200px and the min-width of each flex item is set to 300px then here in this case when the screen is at max size then the min width will actually be the width of each flex item and as soon as we shrink then it will maintain the min-width as long as it can and then it wont shrink anymore and the content will be invisible.
By default flex-grow is 0 and flex-shrink is 1 so if we do flex-shrink:0 then on shrinking the screen the content wont shrink and there will be no change in size and will be invisible.
If there is a row based flexbox and flex-basis is set to 100px and flex-grow is set to 1 and flex-shrink is set to 0 then initially the width will be 100px but as the screen size is increased then all the items will grow to occupy the whole screen size and as we shrink then all the items will shrink to 100px as long as every item is able to be displayed in the container and then the items become invisible as shrink is set to 0.
by default the flex-basis is auto i.e. the width of each flex item will be according to the amount of content so the flex item with more content will have more flex basis and the one with less content will have less width.
But if i want my flex items to have equal width then i can set flex-basis:0 .
The shortcut flex: 1 1 0  first one is grow, second is shrink and the third one is flex-basis and the more shortcut is to write flex:1 ie. grow and shrink is 1 and basis is 0
If i have three containers and if flex values of the containers are 1,2,3 respectively then as these are like ratios so they will maintain the width when they grow or shrink so that the first container is one half the second container and one third the third container.
